'''Problem Statement:
You are given a binary string consisting only of '0' and '1'. In one operation, you can choose a prefix of the string and flip all bits in that prefix ('0' becomes '1', '1' becomes '0').
Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all bits '1'.

Input Format:

A single line containing a binary string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10⁵)

Output Format:

Print a single integer — the minimum number of operations required.'''

s = input()

flips = 0
for i in range(0,len(s)):
    if i!=(len(s)-1):
        if s[i+1]==s[i]:
            continue
        else:
            flips+=1
    else:
        if s[i]=="0":
            flips+=1
            
print(flips)
